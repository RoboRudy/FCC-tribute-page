        <h2>Origin of Patrick Star</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Stephen Hillenburg first designed a prototypic starfish character while teaching marine science at the Ocean Institute in California.[5] He created the character for The Intertidal Zone, an educational picture book used to teach young students at the Institute, which would eventually lead to the creation of SpongeBob SquarePants.</li>
            <li>This prototypic starfish character was much more realistic than Patrick: it had an eyespot on each arm and a large mouth in the center of its body. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation.</li>
            <li>Hillenburg described Patrick as "probably the dumbest guy in town".</li>
            <li>He first appeared in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. Seen as a lazy, overweight and dimwitted pink starfish.</li>
            <li>He is SpongeBob's best friend as well as one of his two neighbors.</li>
            <li>He is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke and first appears in the pilot episode, "Help Wanted."</li>
            <li>Both he and SpongeBob like to bother Squidward; though they do it unknowingly and have good intentions.</li>
            <li>He is the son of Herb and Margie Star and the younger brother of Sam Star.</li>
            <li> Patrick was kicked out of his parents' house at one point and never allowed to come back. He thus created his rock, with the only difference being that he added a satellite antenna to it.</li>
            <li>One day, when his neighbor Squidward was gardening, a pineapple fell from a ship into the ocean, landing on Squidward's garden creating the pineapple house.</li>
            <li>SpongeBob was looking for a house of his own; when all hope seemed lost, SpongeBob and the real estate agent saw the pineapple house's creation and Patty said she had forgotten about the house.</li>
            <li>SpongeBob bought it. To this day, they have been neighbors.</li>
          </ul>
